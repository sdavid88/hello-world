Hello 'hello-world' people!

David here. I love to create, learn and discover new things that are good and could have a positve outcome. 

Like this repository - used as a tool to keep things in a project organized, such as files, images, videos, spreadsheets, data sets and more. In addition, project information can be stored inside a README file.

Into the cloud!
